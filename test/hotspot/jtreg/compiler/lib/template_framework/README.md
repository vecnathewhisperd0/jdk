# Template Framework
The Template Framework allows the generation of code with Templates. The goal is that these Templates are easy to write, and allow regression tests to cover a larger scope, and to make temlate based fuzzing easy to extend.

## Motivation
Often one has to write a large set of tests over many types and code shapes and constant values to more adequately cover compiler features, bugs and optimizations. This is tedious work, and often one writes fewer tests than could have been or should have been written because of time limitations.

With the [Compile Framework](../compile_framework/README.md), we can easily compile and invoke runtime-generated Java code. The Template Framework now provides an easy way to generate such Java code. Templates can be specified with Strings. A simple syntax allows defining holes in these Templates, that can be filled with parameter values or recursive Templates.

This allows the test writer to specify just one or a few Templates, possibly with some parameter holes and a list of parameter values, or with Template holes for recursive Template instantiation. The Template Framework then takes care of generating code for each parameter value, and for filling in recursive Template instantiations, possibly with random code, code shapes and constant values.

## How to use the Template Framework
Please reference the examples found in [examples](../../../testlibrary_tests/template_framework/examples/). Some basic tests can be found in [tests](../../../testlibrary_tests/template_framework/tests/).

### Instantiating a single Template

One can instantiate a single Template directly using `template.instantiate()`, if it has no parameter holes. If there are template holes, these can be filled with `template.where` chaining calls, and after filling all the template holes, the template can be instantiated. Here a simple example:

    // Defiie a Template with name "my_example" that has two parameter holes
    // "param1" and "param2", and a recursive call to a "int_con" CodeGenerator
    // which takes parameters "lo" with value 0 and "hi" with value 100.
    Template template = new Template("my_example",
        """
        package p.xyz;

        public class InnerTest {
            public static int test() {
                return #{param1} + #{param2} + #{:int_con(lo=0,hi=100)};
            }
        }
        """
    );

    // The template is instantiated, and the two parameters are replaced with the
    // provided values, and the recursive CodeGenerator call replaces the corresponding
    // Template hole with a random number from 0 to 100. The resulting code is returned
    // as a String that could be passed on to the Compile Framework.
    String code = template.where("param1", "42").where("param2", "7").instantiate();

### Conveniently instantiating multiple tests into a single class with the TestClassInstantiator

The [TestClassInstantiator](./TestClassInstantiator.java) is a convenient facility that allows the instantiation of multiple tests into a single test class. Please refer to the example [TestInstantiationOfManyTests.java](../../../testlibrary_tests/template_framework/examples/TestInstantiationOfManyTests.java) for various ways of using this utility.

TODO example with IR framework???

## Use case: Regression Fest
Hand-written regression tests are very time consuming, and often fewere tests are written than desired due to time constraints of the developer. With Templates, the developer can simply take the reduced regression test, and turn some constants into Template holes that can then be replaced by random constants, or other interesting code shapes that may trigger special cases of the bug or feature under test. The standard [CodeGeneratorLibrary](./CodeGeneratorLibrary.java) can be used for recursive CodeGenerator instantiations, for random constant generation, random variable sampling, and inserting specific or random intersting code shapes.

## Use case: Extensive feature testing (targetted Fuzzer)
When working on a new feature, or working on a bigger bug, it may be helpful to generate tests for a vast set of parameters, code shapes, operators, class hierarchies, types, constant values, etc. The difference to a simple regression test is simply in the complexity in combinations of templates, parameters and recursive CodeGenerator instantiations. One might want to extend the `CodeGeneratorLibrary` with more options, or implement custom `ProgrammaticCodeGenerators` (see below) to unlock more powerful features.

## Use case: General purpose Template based Fuzzer.
The goal is to test code patterns, language features, libraries and the related compiler optimizations not just in isolation, but in combination, to test their correctness under more circumstances. Existing fuzzers are difficult to extend for new features. The Template Framework is the basis for a Template based Fuzzer, which combines many templates through Template nesting.

TODO decide if this is part of this patch, or a remark for future work.

## The Standard CodeGeneratorLibrary
The standard library is defined in [CodeGeneratorLibrary](./CodeGeneratorLibrary.java), and contains a number of helpful CodeGenerators.

TODO: list all CodeGenerators

## Custom CodeGenerator Library
The standard library can be extended with more functionality. Here a simple example:

    // Create a set of CodeGenerators (e.g. Templates, ProgrammaticCodeGenerators, SelectorCodeGenerators):
    HashSet<CodeGenerator> set = new HashSet<CodeGenerator>();

    set.add(new Template("my_template_1", ...));
    set.add(new Template("my_template_2", ...));
    ...

    // Create an extension library using the set of just defined generators to extend the standard
    // library.
    CodeGeneratorLibrary library = new CodeGeneratorLibrary(CodeGeneratorLibrary.standard(), set);

    // This library can now be passed to a TestClassInstantiator, which then has access to the
    // extended library.

TODO add example with Template and that new test, and "with"

Please refer to the example [TestCustomLibraryForClassFuzzing](../../../testlibrary_tests/template_framework/examples/TestCustomLibraryForClassFuzzing.java).

## Implementing Custom ProgrammaticCodeGenerators
It is good practice to use Templates where ever possible. But in some cases, it is required to implement more powerful functionality, that can query some custom state during the code generation. For this, one can use the [ProgrammaticCodeGenerator](./ProgrammaticCodeGenerator.java), which allows the user to specify a lambda function that is called during instantiation and has direct access to the internals of the Template Framework, and can generate code or make recursive CodeGenerator instantiations.

Please refer to the example [TestCustomLibraryForClassFuzzing](../../../testlibrary_tests/template_framework/examples/TestCustomLibraryForClassFuzzing.java) and the definition of standard library functions in [CodeGeneratorLibrary](./CodeGeneratorLibrary.java) for further examples.

## Implementing Custom SelectorCodeGenerators
TODO - first need a better example!
