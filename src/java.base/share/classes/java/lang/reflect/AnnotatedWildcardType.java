/**
 * {@code AnnotatedWildcardType} represents the potentially annotated use of a
 * wildcard type argument, whose upper or lower bounds may themselves represent
 * annotated uses of types.  Since the use of a wildcard type argument is not
 * the use of a type, it will only be returned by APIs where uses of type
 * arguments may appear, such as {@link
 * AnnotatedParameterizedType#getAnnotatedActualTypeArguments()
 * AnnotatedParameterizedType::getAnnotatedActualTypeArguments}.
 * <p>
 * For example, an annotated use {@code @TA ? extends @TB Number} has an
 * annotation {@code @TA} and represents the wildcard type argument {@code ?
 * extends Number}.  Its lower bound is the annotated use {@code @TB Number}
 * with an annotation {@code @TB}, representing the {@code Number} class.  It
 * has no upper bound.
 * <p>
 * Two {@code AnnotatedWildcardType} objects should be compared using the {@link
 * Object#equals equals} method.
