/**
 * {@code ParameterizedType} represents a parameterized type, such as {@code
 * Collection<String>}.  A parameterized type is a class or interface.
 * <p>
 * A parameterized type is created the first time it is needed by a reflective
 * method, as specified in this package. When a parameterized type {@code p} is
 * created, the generic class or interface declaration that {@linkplain
 * #getRawType() defines} {@code p} is resolved, and all type arguments of
 * {@code p} are created recursively.  See {@link TypeVariable} for details on
 * the creation process for type variables. Repeated creation of a parameterized
 * type has no effect.
 * <p>
 * Two {@code ParameterizedType} objects should be compared using the {@link
 * #equals equals} method.
